// How do we assign a value to a variable?
// With the assignment operator
// ***********************************************************

// How do we change the value of a variable?
// You assign a new value to the variable 
// ********************************************************

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
// We assign the original variable to a new variable using "="
// ***********************************************************

// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
// Declare involves using a keyword such as var, let, or const followed by the variable name. 
// Assigning a value to a variable means giving it a specific value to hold. It involves using the assignment operator (=)  For example: let a = 0
// Definition in JavaScript is the process of creating a new variable and giving it a name and a value.

What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
Pseudocode is a high-level, human-readable description of an algorithm or program. 
It is used to plan and describe the logic of a program without getting bogged down in the details of a specific programming language.
Pseudocode is a useful tool for programmers because it can help them:
Plan and design programs
Communicate with other programmers

******************************************************************
What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
There is no general answer but a general guideline often referred to as the "80-20 rule" suggests that you should spend 
about 80% of your time planning and thinking about the problem and 20% of your time on actual implementation. 
This rule highlights the importance of investing ample time in understanding the problem, analyzing requirements, designing a solution, and considering potential edge cases and pitfalls before writing the code.
